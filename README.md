This project is a Javascript Tetris game, using p5.js libraries.

This repository was inspired by the amazing work of Dan Shiffman on the [Coding Train youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw). 
I am accepting pull requests for bug fixes, minor improvements to gameplay, and visual design. I do not want the code to be more complex as the goal is fast readability and understanding.
